# monash

This package provides Rmarkdown templates for use at Monash University, Department of Econometrics & Business Statistics.

It contains

 * Monash EBS working paper template
 * Monash letter template
 * Monash exam template
 * Monash consulting report template
 * Monash beamer slides (for the Monash Business School)
 * Memo template (nothing to do with Monash, but a nice format)

The `slides()` function is actually a wrapper to use the `monash` template in the [`binb`](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/binb) package.

There are also Monash thesis templates available:

 * PhD thesis template: https://github.com/robjhyndman/MonashThesis
 * Honours thesis template: https://github.com/robjhyndman/MonashHonoursThesis
